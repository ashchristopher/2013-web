<p>The schedule for PyCon 2013 includes talks, tutorials, and sprints over
Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>We welcome everyone in the Canadian Python community to come and share your
ideas, experiences, and expertise. Whether you're new to Python or a seasoned
expert, if you've got something interesting to share, we want to hear about it.
A conference with a diverse set of good topics will give everyone the
opportunity to learn something new and cool.</p>

<p>Nervous about your lack of presenter experience? We'll work to connect you
with resources and people to help you prepare. You might also consider
co-presenting with a more experienced presenter. And once you've rocked PyCon
Canada 2013, you can take that experience to help you gear up for the big
PyCon conference in Montr&eacute;al.</p>

<h3>Submitting a Talk or Tutorial</h3>
<p>We would prefer 20 minute talks, although 45 minute talks will also be
considered. Tutorials are 3 hours. We also welcome ideas for sprints. The
deadline to submit talks and tutorials is June 21st, 2013.</p>

  <p>Please <a href="{% url "account_signup" %}?next={% url "dashboard" %}">create an account &raquo;</a> or <a href="{% url "account_login" %}?next={% url "dashboard" %}">log in &raquo;</a>.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>To submit a talk or tutorial, you will need to include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name of the talk or tutorial</li>
    <li>Length of the talk/tutorial</li>
    <li>Intended audience (assumed level of knowledge)</li>
    <li>Abstract for the talk/tutorial - 300 chars max</li>
    <li>Outline of the talk/tutorial</li>
    <li>Additional notes for the proposal reviewers. This can include
    additional background information such as links to other presentations you
    have done, or links to blog posts, articles or code related to your
    presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">Lightning talks</a>
are 5 minute talks that are done in quick succession. At PyCon USA, lightning
talks are drawn from a hat, on the spot during the conference. Due to their
ever increasing popularity, a large number of people end up not being able to
present the 5 minute talks they prepared (too many talks, too little time), so
we've decided to try something new. PyCon Canada will be confirming 12
lightning talks in advance, and we have one reserved for you!</p>

{% if user.is_authenticated %}

{% else %}
  <p>Please <a href="{% url "account_signup" %}?next={% url "dashboard" %}">create an account &raquo;</a> or <a href="{% url "account_login" %}?next={% url "dashboard" %}">log in &raquo;</a>.</p>
